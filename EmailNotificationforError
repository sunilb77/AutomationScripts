Here is an example of a Linux shell script that can be used to send an email when an error is detected in a log file:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# This script will send an email when an error is detected in a log file

# Define the log file and recipient email address
log_file="/var/log/mylog.log"
recipient="youremail@example.com"

# Check if the log file contains the string "error"
if grep -q "error" $log_file; then
  # Send email using the mail command
  echo "An error has been detected in the log file" | mail -s "Error in Log File" $recipient
fi
